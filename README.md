# Avanade DevOps HOL

These are the hands on labs associated with the Avanade DevOps Practitioners course.  This is based to a large part on the [PartsUnlimitedHOL](https://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/basic/GettingStarted.html) but simplified to use the Visual Studio MVC sample application.

You can accomplish these labs using Visual Studio 2017 on your local computer, but you may want to consider doing the labs using an Azure VM as the development machine.  This not only keeps you from having to make changes to your local environment, but it gives you additional experience using Azure.

To start setting up your environment, make sure to follow the steps in the [Getting Started](getting-started/README.md) lab.
